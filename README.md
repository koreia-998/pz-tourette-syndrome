# 🧠 Tourette Syndrome — A Project Zomboid Trait Mod

This mod adds a new negative trait: **Tourette Syndrome**.

Your character occasionally blurts out words.  
Sometimes it’s a quiet mutter.  
Sometimes it’s a full-volume, profanity-laced outburst that echoes across the street and into the jaws of the undead.

It’s random.  
It’s loud.  
It’s incredibly inconvenient.

Sandbox options let you fine-tune how often it happens, how loud it is, and whether or not the swearing is *censored for your grandmother*.

It won’t help you survive.  
It might get you killed.  
But it’ll feel… honest.
